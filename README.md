# Kaggle - E-Commerce Funnel Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
**E-Commerce Funnel Analysis** is a personal project focused on analyzing customer behavior data to derive insights for optimizing purchase conversion rates. 
Based on a massive dataset of approximately **67.5 million log entries**, I analyzed **DAU (Daily Active Users) trends** and the **Conversion Funnel (View → Cart → Purchase)** to identify "golden times" for marketing and bottlenecks where user drop-offs occur.
